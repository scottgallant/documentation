## Codeship currently only supports [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) based repositories. While we do have plans to integrate with other providers in the future we don't have anything concrete planned at the moment.

There are no plans to integrate with other SCM tools like Subversion.

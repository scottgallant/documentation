Codeship does not allow root level access (i.e. commands run via `sudo`) for security reasons. If you are looking to install a dependency that's not available via a language specific package manager (e.g. `gem`, `pip`, `npm` or a similar tool), please contact [support@codeship.com](support@codeship.com) or send us a message using our in-app messenger.

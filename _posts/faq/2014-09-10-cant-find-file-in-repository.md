When you get an error indicating that a file can't be found but you are sure it exists in the repository it might be due to case sensitivity of the file system on our machines.

## OSX and case sensitive file systems

By default OS X has a case insensitive file system, so *Testfile.xml* and *testfile.xml* are treated the same. Our Linux filesystem is case sensitive though, so those would be two different files and the commands won't find the file if you don't use the exact same file name in your code.

## Solution

Whenever you see an error of a missing file make sure that the name of the file on disk and the name used in your code are exactly the same, with no case differences.

You are able to activate build debugging at the bottom of the build detail view for projects running on the classic infrastructure. The SSH debugging session only works for branches still available in your repository.

If you are using the Docker infrastructure, you can debug locally by using the command-line tool. You can refer to the [Installation Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url docker/jet/2015-05-25-installation %}) to get your builds running locally for debugging.

## Machine State

When you start a SSH Debug session we will clone the repository and set up all environment variables that you defined and that we set by default. ***We won't run any setup or test commands.*** This gives you a clean machine so you can fully test and debug your application on Codeship. No generated files or changes done in any previous builds will be available. ***The SSH session is completely separate from any builds before.***


## Codeship Command

Inside the SSH session, you have access to the Codeship command. It provides some convenient methods to debug your project.

```shell
cs help
```

## Existing Directories

There are a few directories in your home directory (`~`).
The most important one is the `clone` directory. The `clone` directory is your project root and contains your source code.

## Useful commands

Get insight into Environment variables.

```shell
printenv
```

You can use `grep` to filter the Environment

```shell
printenv | grep CI
```

## NodeJS version

By default we set the NodeJS version to `0.10.25`

You can manage the NodeJS version via NVM.

To install a new version of NodeJS use

```shell
nvm install 0.11
```

or use a different version of NodeJS

```shell
nvm use 0.10.25
```

## Timeout

The debug build will shutdown itself after `60 minutes`

You can shutdown the debug build manually by using

```shell
cs exit
```

## Clear Dependency Cache

If you want to start really fresh, you can clear the Dependency Cache by using

```shell
cs clear-cache
```

## What is a SSH public key?

SSH is a protocol which uses asymmetric key algorithms for authentication.
If you want to dig deeper into Public-Key cryptography you can start by reading the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).

## Get my public SSH Key

You can retrieve your public SSH Key by using the following command in your Terminal.

```shell
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

## Generate my SSH Key

To generate your own SSH Key, open up your Terminal and use this command.

```shell
ssh-keygen -b 8192
```

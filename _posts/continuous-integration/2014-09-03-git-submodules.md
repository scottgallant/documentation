Git Submodules are initialized automatically. This will be triggered by the existence of the `.gitmodules` file in your project root.

We initialize the submodules with the following git command

`git submodule update --recursive --init`

In case of troubles with permissions have a look at [how to give access to other repositories]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url faq/2014-09-10-access-to-other-repositories-fails-during-build %}).

Also make sure to access the submodule via a SSH based URL (i.e. similar to `git@github.com:...`) and not via HTTP/S. This is especially true for private repositories, which won't work otherwise.

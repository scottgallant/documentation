Sometimes you might want to run a server or another process in the background. You can use the following template to run any of your commands as a background process

```shell
nohup bash -c "YOUR_COMMAND 2>&1 &"
```

Sometimes your server might take a couple of seconds to start, you need to add a sleep then to make sure it is up and running

```shell
nohup bash -c "YOUR_COMMAND 2>&1 &" && sleep 4
```

To see the output append **cat nohup.out** to the command

```shell
nohup bash -c "YOUR_COMMAND 2>&1 &" && sleep 4; cat nohup.out
```

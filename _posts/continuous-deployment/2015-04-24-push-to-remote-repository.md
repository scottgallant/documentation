If you want to deploy your application by doing a `git push` to a remote repository please follow these steps:

1. Remove the Codeship deploy key from the GitHub or BitBucket repository. You'll find this option in the repository settings on the respective service.
2. Add the public key from your projects _General_ settings page to a so called [machine user](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users) and provide this user with access to your repository. (Note that though we link to a GitHub documentation page, the process will work on BitBucket as well.)
3. Add a _script based deployment_ to your project and include the commands from [deployments/git-push.sh](https://github.com/codeship/scripts/blob/master/deployments/git_push.sh).
4. You might want to modify the commit message to include `--skip-ci` if you push to a remote repository which is configured on Codeship as well, as the push would trigger a new build otherwise.

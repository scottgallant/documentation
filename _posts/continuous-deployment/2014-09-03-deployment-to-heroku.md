## Settings
Within Codeship you are able to configure [Deployment Pipelines]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url continuous-deployment/2014-09-03-deployment-pipelines %}). You can easily add a Heroku Deployment choosing Heroku as deployment method.

You are asked to enter the **name of your Heroku application** and your **Heroku API key**. You need to create the application on Heroku first.

By clicking on **more options** you can configure additional settings.

### URL of your Heroku Application
After each deployment we check if your app is up. Therefore we call (`wget`) either the default `*.herokuapp.com` URL or the URL you specified here.

If this URL requires **basic auth** please enter: `http://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_URL`

## Run commands on Heroku
With the latest versions of the Heroku toolkit it is now possible to run arbitrary command without the need for our `heroku_run` wrapper. Simply specify the command in the following form in a *custom script* deployment. This will trigger using the newest codepath and will exit with the correct exit code.

```shell
heroku run --exit-code --app ${HEROKU_APPLICATION_NAME} -- ${COMMAND_TO_RUN}
```

## Run migration after the app is deployed
You can specify to run the migration during the Heroku deployment within the ***more options*** section. If you want to run your migration after the deployment, you can add a [Script Deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url continuous-deployment/2014-09-03-deployment-with-custom-scripts %}) under the Heroku deployment and run the migration there.

```shell
heroku run --exit-code --app ${HEROKU_APPLICATION_NAME} -- bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

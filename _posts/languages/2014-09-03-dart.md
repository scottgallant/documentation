`$DART_SDK` is available in the Environment and included in the PATH. The installed version of the Dart SDK is `1.5.1`

You can use these commands from the Dart SDK:

* Dart-to-JavaScript compiler (dart2js)
* Dart VM (dart)
* Dart package manager (pub)
* Dart Analyzer (dart_analyzer)

## Installing dependencies

You can install any dependencies you defined in your pubspec.yaml by running

```shell
pub get
```

## Running tests

As dart currently doesn't have a default way to run your tests you can use
exactly the same command to run those tests as you would on your own system

## Browser testing

We automatically have `xvfb` running on our System. You can use Firefox, Chrome
or PhantomJS to run your Dart tests in a browser. You can read more in our
[Browser Testing Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url continuous-integration/2014-09-03-browser-testing %})

## Newer Versions

Sometimes it's really hard for us to keep every language up-to-date on our builds. If you want to use a newer Dart version you could accomplish this like so:

```shell
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/latest/sdk/dartsdk-linux-x64-release.zip
unzip -o dartsdk-linux-x64-release.zip -d ~
```

*Please note* that we can't officially support software that is not pre-installed on the VMs by us.

## Coveralls Discount Code

Thanks to our partnership with Coveralls we can provide a 25% Discount for 3 months. Use the code **"coverallslovescodeship"** and [get started right away](https://coveralls.io/).

## Setup for Ruby Project

Starting with Coveralls and Codeship is easy. Their docs do a great job of guiding you, but all there is to set up your Ruby app is add a .coveralls.yml file to your codebase that contains your Coveralls key:

```
repo_token: YOUR_COVERALLS_TOKEN
```

It is also possible to set this in the Environment setting of your Codeship project

```
COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN=YOUR_COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN
```

then simply require the Gem in your Gemfile

```
gem 'coveralls', require: false
```

and put the initializers into your spec_helper.rb or env.rb depending on which framework you use

```ruby
require 'coveralls'
Coveralls.wear!
```

If you want to combine the coverage data from different frameworks, add the following to your spec_helper.rb and env.rb (also take a look at Coveralls Docs – mentioned above – on that topic).

```ruby
# Coveralls with Rspec and Cucumber
require 'coveralls'
Coveralls.wear_merged!
SimpleCov.merge_timeout 3600

# MAKING SURE SIMPLECOV WORKS WITH THE PARALLEL_TESTS GEM
SimpleCov.command_name "RSpec/Cucumber:#{Process.pid.to_s}#{ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER']}"
```

Then you need to add a rake task that pushes your coverage report as soon as your build is finished.

```ruby
require 'coveralls/rake/task'
Coveralls::RakeTask.new
```

To push the data to Coveralls, add the following after your test commands on Codeship:

```ruby
bundle exec rake coveralls:push
```


## Setup for other languages

Coveralls supports a lot of other languages. Check out their fantastic [documentation](https://coveralls.io/docs/supported_continuous_integration).
